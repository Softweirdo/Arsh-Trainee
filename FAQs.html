</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are plenty of challenges, but the most prominent ones are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Governance Framework: The Indian Governance Framework is stuck between the Centre and State structure. State laws incentives which are structured to attract investments as per the state government&rsquo;s policy are subject to multiple approvals which emanate from Central Government agencies. The adjoining states could be so different in terms of various taxes that a car price could vary 10% between neighboring states.</li>
<li>Policy Environment: There is a fair amount of ambiguity and confusion around policy matters. Having a local representative is crucial to manage this bottleneck.</li>
<li>Diversity: India is an incredibly diverse nation. It has 31 States and more than 2000 ethnic groups. The economic needs are sometimes overcome by cultural and political ideologies. Case in point is the moving of assembly line of the smallest car in the world &ndash; NANO from the state of West Bengal to Gujarat.</li>
<li>Regulatory Framework: Indian economy was highly regulated when economic reforms and liberalization was introduced in 1991. Even then, the regulatory bodies still reign supreme. Layers of duties and loads of paperwork make doing business in India quite daunting.</li>
<li>Slow pace: Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to do business in India as India has its own pace. It is crucial to hire a local representative to head the venture who would be able to get the work done faster than the outside boss.</li>
